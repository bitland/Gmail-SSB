Gmail-SSB
=========

Gmail-SSB is a [site-specific browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser) for Gmail that's optimized for Google's fancy-schmancy voice/video calls. There are better Gmail SSBs out there, such as [Mailplane](http://mailplaneapp.com/). Or you could roll your own using [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/). Unfortunately, neither of those quite fit my needs:

  * Mailplane has a ton of features, but none of which I need. I'm already super-productive using Gmail's native shortcut keys.
  * Fluid is also great at what it does. Sadly, closing the Fluid window releases the WebView, which kills any voice/video conversations you have open.

Gmail-SSB addresses these issues so I can work safely in Safari without fear of accidentally closing my Gmail tab during a call.

**Caveats:** This project is literally 90 minutes old. It may erase your hard drive and delete all your Gmail, but probably not. Still, you've been warned.

FEATURES
--------

 * Dedicated app just for Gmail.
 * Open/close/hide/minimize the app without disconnecting your voice/video calls.
 * Incoming calls will ring in the background even if the window is closed.
 * Visual alerts when incoming calls come in [soon]
 * Growl notifications of new emails and calls [soon]
 * Sparkle updates
